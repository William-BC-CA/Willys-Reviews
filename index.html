        <p>Welcome fellow internet user! This is a website created by myself!
            This was created for an assignment for my Multimedia class!
            I am currently a College student and this is my second year.
            I am hoping to major in Computer Science and find a job in the work field!</p>
        <p>This website is aimed to provide reviews of certain products, having gathered research from other websites.</p>
