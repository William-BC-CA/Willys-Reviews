                <td>These Apple AirPod Pros are truly a pair of headphones that are super convenient when it comes to travel.
                    They sound great, are extremely light and simple to use. You won't have to worry about a bulky cord sticking out as it uses bluetooth to connect to your smartphone.
                    As they were built extremely small and wireless, there is a down side as you could potentially lose one or both of them.
                    Not only that, it comes with a hefty price tag, potentially discouraging casual listeners to buy them. Overall, they are great for what they are.

                    The software has one of the most intuitive interfaces to use, therefore making it easy for beginner programmers to adapt.
                    There's no trial or subscription, everything is free! Best of all, there are extensions that you could use to enhance your programming experience! 
                    However, it can take a toll on battery life as it is powered by Electron, which is a tool commonly used for browsers like Google Chrome. You can view more about Electron <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)">here</a>!
                    Overall, a very good software for easy programming.
